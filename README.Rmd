The purpose of ``amloconf`` is to provide a tool to retrieve the stenographic
versions of the conferences given by the Mexican President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador,
in handy-dialog-formatted lists.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alejandroxag/amloconf")
```
## Example

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

```{r example,eval=FALSE}
# library(amloconf)
## basic example code
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
