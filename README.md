The purpose of `amloconf` is to provide a tool to retrieve the
stenographic versions of the conferences given by the Mexican President,
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, in handy-dialog-formatted lists.

This tool could be useful to carry out text mining and sentiment
analysis on the Mexican President’s press conferences.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alejandroxag/amloconf")
```

## Example

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

``` r
library(amloconf)
## basic example code
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->

<!-- summary(cars) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- plot(pressure) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
